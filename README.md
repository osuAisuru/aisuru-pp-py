# aisuru-pp-py

Difficulty and performance calculation for all [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/) modes. Modified for Aisuru!

This is a python binding to the Rust library [aisuru-pp](https://github.com/osuAisuru/aisuru-pp) which was bootstrapped through [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/PyO3).
Since all the heavy lifting is done by Rust, aisuru-pp-py comes with a very fast performance.
Check out aisuru-pp's README for more info.
